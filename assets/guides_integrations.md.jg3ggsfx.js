The following are common types of integration:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Internal Integration</strong>: Linking Amiqus with internal systems and applications that your team uses in their daily workflow. Your integration will allow the transfer of data between systems and help reduce the need for repeat manual entry.</p></li><li><p><strong>External Integration</strong>: Organisations who operate a platform can build an integration to allow their customers to sync their Amiqus data with their platform.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Code Integrations</strong> If you are not a developer, you can still use Amiqus with some of our existing partner integrations such as <a href="https://www.clio.com/uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Clio</a> an <a href="https://www.denovobi.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Denovo</a> with no coding required.
